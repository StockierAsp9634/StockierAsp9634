### Hi there 👋, I'm Arnav(he/him/his).

I am a current high school student and aspiring **quantitative analyst** from 📍 Sacramento(Go Kings 👑!!!), California. 

I've had a passion for financial topics for as long as I can remember. The stock market and the global economy are topics that captivate me and draw my attention. 

But recently, I discovered I had another undiscovered passion: programming. The idea of writing lines on a computer that can do great things and genuinely help people in a positive way captivates me. 

These two passions seemed to be on opposing ends of the spectrum(we've all heard of the war between Wall Street and Silicon Valley), leaving me forced to choose. However, there is one career that brings all of my passions together in one job: ***quantitative analysis of financial markets***. Data science, programming, high level mathematics, finance, and more all in one spot. The perfect spot for me. 

The only problem is, **it's hard.** 

Join me on my journey through the world of quantitative analysis:
